# Reed-Solomon Error-Correcting Codes

A standalone, zero-dependency implementation of [Reed-Solomon error-correcting
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction) over
the Galois field GF(2^8), built from first principles for learning purposes.

Author: [Nathan Kimutai (tekindet)](https://github.com/tekindet)

## Overview

Reed-Solomon codes add redundant (parity) symbols to a message so that errors
introduced during transmission or storage can be detected and corrected. This
project implements the underlying machinery from scratch:

- **Finite field arithmetic** — multiplication, division, addition, and
  exponentiation over GF(2^8) using log/antilog tables.
- **Polynomial arithmetic** — addition, multiplication, and polynomial
  division over GF(2^8) via a `GF256Poly` class.
- **Generator polynomial** — builds `G(x) = (x - α^0)(x - α^1) ... (x - α^(n-1))`
  for a chosen number of parity symbols `nsym`.
- **Encoding** — computes parity symbols as the remainder of the message
  polynomial divided by the generator, producing the final codeword.

## Project status

⚠️ **Work in progress.** Encoding is working, but decoding/error correction is
not implemented yet. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## Usage

```python
from main import build_generator_poly, GF256Poly

msg = "this is a test message"
nsym = 4  # number of parity (redundancy) symbols

msg_bytes = [ord(c) for c in msg]

M_x = GF256Poly(msg_bytes)          # message polynomial
G_x = build_generator_poly(nsym)    # generator polynomial

# Shift the message by nsym degrees, then divide by G(x);
# the remainder P(x) is the parity. Codeword = message + parity.
shift_factor = GF256Poly([1] + [0] * nsym)
M_shifted = M_x * shift_factor
Q_x, P_x = M_shifted.divmod(G_x)
C_x = M_shifted + P_x

print(f"Final Codeword C(x):\n{C_x}")
```

Running the module directly executes the example above:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How it works

1. Represent the message bytes as the coefficients of a polynomial `M(x)` over
   GF(2^8).
2. Build the generator polynomial `G(x)` from consecutive powers of `α` (the
   primitive element of the field).
3. Shift `M(x)` by `nsym` degrees and divide by `G(x)`.
4. Append the remainder `P(x)` — the parity symbols — to the message. The
   resulting codeword `C(x)` is divisible by `G(x)`, which is what later allows
   errors to be detected and corrected.
